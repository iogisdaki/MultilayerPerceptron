# MultilayerPerceptron
A simple vanilla neural net written in java. It provides the ability of having multiple hidden layers and choosing the number of neurons per layer.
Also, I have to mention this code only provides FCNNs(fully connected neural nets).
My hope is to extend this to a more generic neural net library in the future.
